# Coursera_notes
Self made notes of Coursera courses with my tablet, which I bought for improving my self-studying performance.

##IMPORTANT
All the cropped images belong to DeepLearning.ai lecture slides.

###Why do I publish my notes?
- For helping others better understand the concepts.
- For proving I have studied everything and I am not a cheater.
- For having a backup.

###Courses and specializations included:
- [Machine Learning by Stanford](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning) -> Basics of machine learning, from linear regression to support vector machines or an OCR practical case.
- [Deep Learning Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning) -> Specialization consisting of 5 courses.


I highly recommend to anyone reading this document that studies these online resources. They are simply amazing.
